          Choosing Excel Global College <br>
          turned out to be a good outcome <br>
          for me. I am currently doing ACCA <br>
          in Excel Global College. ACCA <br>
          requires personal development <br>
          and a quite a supportive centre for<br>
           achieving good marks. According to<br>
            me Excel Global College has <br>
            provided an outstanding <br>
            environment and factors which <br>
            helped me a lot to achieve my<br>
             perfection in ACCA part 1. By <br>
             providing CBE centre right in the <br>
             same platform makes it more <br>
             flexible for me. Above all these, I<br>
              am also doing accounting <br>
              packages like Sage, QuickBooks<br>
               and Tally in Excel Global College <br>
               which goes hand in hand with my <br>
               career.

          I am currently doing ABE in Excel <br>
          Global College and I believe that <br>
          this is one of the best colleges <br>
          because the management, <br>
          teachers and staff members are <br>
          very supportive in my academic <br>
          progress. The best thing is that the <br>
          college provides 100% pass <br>
          guarantee. Excel Global College <br>
          also pays attention to <br>
          extracurricular activities such as <br>
          debates, sports, trips, etc. which <br>
          enhances personal development<br>
           and a friendly atmosphere for the <br>
           college. I am glad to be part <br>
           of Excel Global College.<br>

          I am an ABE student from Kenya,<br>
           currently studying in Excel Global <br>
           College, brought up by an <br>
           extended family, who have all<br>
            supported me in my career and <br>
            lifestyle success. I chose ABE <br>
            because it provides a broad range <br>
            of knowledge under Business <br>
            Management, which my father <br>
            being an accountant, gave me an<br>
             opportunity to understand and<br>
              have a basic base line in the world <br>
              of business, finance and <br>
              management. However my major<br>
               success came from Excel Global<br>
                College.
