          Choosing Excel Global College turned out to be a good outcome for me. I am currently doing ACCA in Excel Global College. ACCA requires personal development and a quite a supportive centre for achieving good marks.<br>
            <br>According to me Excel Global College has provided an outstanding environment and factors which helped me a lot to achieve my perfection in ACCA part 1. By providing CBE centre right in the same platform makes it more
             flexible for me.<br>
             <br>Above all these, I am also doing accounting packages like Sage, QuickBooks and Tally in Excel Global College which goes hand in hand with my career.

          I am an ABE student from Kenya, currently studying in Excel Global College, brought up by an extended family, who have all supported me in my career and lifestyle success.<br>
             <br>I chose ABE because it provides a broad range of knowledge under Business Management, which my father being an accountant, gave me an opportunity to understand and have a basic base line in the world of business, finance and management.<br>
          <br>However my major success came from Excel Global College.<br>
